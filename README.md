# MosaIT
MosaIT senior project

MosaIT is a dynamic photo mosaic generation tool that requests an image from a user, a keyword, and some additional options
then downloads images from the web based on the keyword. Those images are used to build a unique photo mosaic from the user's
image. This repo contains the back-end mosaic building code.
